<p>For most of my career I worked as a backend developer, only dabbling sporadically into an operations role, so I would be lying if I said that impostor syndrome didn&rsquo;t kick in during my first few days at this new role, but luckily my team is super friendly, helping, and understanding, and my confidence is getting bigger as days pass. I think I made the right decision deciding to jump into this new adventure.</p>
<p>Switching jobs is never easy, specially after almost a decade at my previous work, and thus some of my schedules were affected, like the weekly cadence of <a href="https://buttondown.email/inkel">newsletter</a> or writing into this blog. I hope to get back into rhythm soon.</p>
<p>This past month I&rsquo;ve spent it mostly going through the onboarding process, getting to know my team, some other teams' leaders, and familiarizing with the codebase and tools like <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/">Grafana</a>, <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/loki/">Loki</a>, and <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/tanka/">Tanka</a>. And I&rsquo;ve even found the time to add a <a href="https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet/pull/525">performance contribution</a> to a third-party library!</p>
<p>There are still lots of things to learn, but for now I&rsquo;ll  continue to learn more about this amazing company and the work I&rsquo;ll be doing, improving my skills, and learning a few more tricks. The future looks really bright!</p>
