<ul>
<li><a href="https://warpspire.com/posts/url-design">URL Design</a><br>
Old but gold. Kyle Neath was one of the original designers at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, and in this essay he talks about how to build good URLs and why that’s important. I keep coming back to this article from time to time, because it’s timeless.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/nextux/design-better-forms-96fadca0f49c#.ziclgg10o">Design Better Forms</a><br>
<em>Common mistakes designers make and how to fix them</em>. Oh boy, many times I was guilty of doing most of these! Definitely not exclusively for designers; if you ever need to implement a form, you <strong>are</strong> to check this post, print it, frame it, and hang it in an always visible place near your computer. Your users will thank you.</li>
<li><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/11/12/cat.html">The Source History of Cat</a><br>
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/cat"><code>cat</code></a>is undeniably one of most used programs in any *nix based operating system, and this is a nice article trying to find out more about it by inspecting its source code. Recommended to accompany a cup of coffee.</li>
<li><a href="https://thenewstack.io/brian-kernighan-remembers-the-origins-of-grep/">Brian Kernighan Remembers the Origins of ‘grep’</a><br>
My life wouldn’t be the same if it weren’t for <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep"><code>grep</code></a>. I simply love it. And like the article above this is also about the history of a command, but in a different way and told by someone directly linked to its inception.</li>
<li><a href="https://work.lisk.in/2020/11/20/even-faster-bash-startup.html">Even faster bash startup</a><br>
As a Bash user I’ve found this article very enlightening. I’ve got to go through all my computers to check my startup times, I’m sure I will greatly benefit from it.</li>

<p><a href="https://corecursive.com/058-brian-kernighan-unix-bell-labs/">The Birth of UNIX with Brian Kernighan</a><br>
Yes, Brian Kernighan again. What can I say? I love the man, he is one of my programming heroes. And this interview is just fantastic. At 51 minutes it can be a bit long, but let me assure that you’ll do yourself a favour if you dedicate some time to just sit back and listen to it… but if you can’t do that, DON’T PANIC! There’s a transcript of it.</p>
