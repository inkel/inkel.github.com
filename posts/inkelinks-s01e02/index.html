<li><a href="https://owenou.com/upterm/">Upterm - Secure Terminal Sharing</a><br>
I never did too much pair programming, but for sure this looks like an interesting take on making it easier to share a terminal with others.</li>
<li><a href="https://jpmens.net/2016/03/05/a-shell-command-to-create-json-jo/">A shell command to create JSON: jo</a><br>
My good friend Mat√≠as Aguirre (<a href="https://twitter.com/linuxaddict">@linuxaddict on Twitter</a>) shared this with me. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve never heard of it before, this is an awesome utility!</li>
<li><a href="https://metaredux.com/posts/2020/07/07/supercharge-your-bash-history.html">Supercharge Your Bash History</a><br>
Excellent article on how to configure Bash history to show meaningful information and not just every single thing you type in your terminal.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/vc/">How to make video calls almost as good as face-to-face</a><br>
In this day and era, video calls are becoming more important at every minute. This article might seem long, but the tl;dr section is concise to give you already lots of pointers. Sadly, for folks like myself in countries where technology is becoming too expensive this will be a ‚Äúlook at how good my setup could be‚Äù article.</li>
<li><a href="https://gauthier.uk/blog/who/">The UNIX <code>who</code> command</a><br>
Nice and short post on how using simple tools like <code>strace</code> and <code>man</code> one can mimic the behavior of a program.</li>

<p><a href="https://changelog.com/gotime/145">F√º≈∫≈æƒØ√±g with Katie Hockman, Roberto Clapis, &amp; Filippo Valsorda</a><br>
One of my favourite podcast shows is Go Time, and not so long ago they released an episode on fuzzing, a testing technique where you provide invalid data to your program and monitor for crashes. Whether you‚Äôre a Go developer or not this episode is highly recommended of only because you‚Äôll learn new things!</p>
