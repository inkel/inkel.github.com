    <p>For years I disliked playing games. Never before in my life I had a gaming console, and the last game I played from start to end was The Secret of Monkey Island. But a couple of years ago I decided to buy a PlayStation 4 and I&rsquo;m extremely happy with that decision. The main reason was of course to start playing myself, but also to raise my kids in a house where gaming is &ldquo;normal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Why did I wait so long?!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a hardcore gamer, not even close, but since I bought my PS4 I play at least one hour almost every night, as a way of cooling off my mind before going to bed. I find it very relaxing and entertaining. I mostly play solo games, the idea of working online with others doesn&rsquo;t attract me, as I take this time as a <em>me time</em> and I don&rsquo;t want to engage with others. I know that I&rsquo;m missing lots of fun, or so I&rsquo;ve been told, but I&rsquo;m happy with this decision.</p>
<p>Over the course of the upcoming months I&rsquo;ll try and leave some &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; on some of the games I played so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizon: Zero Dawn</li>
<li>God of War</li>
<li>Uncharted Saga</li>
<li>The WItcher 3</li>
<li>Detroit: Becoming Human</li>
<li>Mass Effect: Andromeda</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Rise of the Tomb Raider</li>
<li>The Last of Us</li>
<li>Dragon Age: Inquisition</li>
</ul>
<p>I cannot finish this post without saying this: the very first game I played, <a href="https://www.guerrilla-games.com/play/horizon">Horizon: Zero Dawn</a>, I fell in love with the character, the world, and the story behind it:</p>
