    <p>It&rsquo;s finally over. This awful year has ended. My work life <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/typical-workday-at-theorem/">hasn&rsquo;t changed much</a>, although I had to <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/work-blocks/">organize my work blocks</a> in a better way. My personal life, on the other hand, was quite affected, specially for my kids and partner; they were the most affected by having to start kindergarden classes via Zoom (my kids), and almost completely stop they work life (my partner).</p>
<p>I did manage to do some stuff that I find nice to share, and hopefully will continue doing in 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>I dedicated more time to this blog again.</li>
<li>I have a <a href="https://buttondown.email/inkel" title="inkelinks">newsletter</a> now; please go and subscribe!</li>
<li>For the first time in my life I joined the <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode-2020/">Advent of Code</a>, although for different reasons I&rsquo;ve stopped working on the challenges; I&rsquo;m planning on continue with them in my upcoming vacations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in <em>magical dates</em> and I know it&rsquo;s not that January 1st, 2021 will be automatically better: COVID-19 still exists, travel is restricted, the economy in this country (Argentina) isn&rsquo;t getting any better, etc, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to see what the new year will bring and work on making things better, not only for me, but for my family.</p>
