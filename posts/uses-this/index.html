    <p>I always liked the interviews at <a href="https://usesthis.com/">Uses This</a>, I find it really interesting knowing other people&rsquo;s setups. And given that I do not foresee them interviewing me anytime soon, I went ahead and wrote my own.</p>
<h2 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you, and what do you do?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m Leandro López, better known on the Internet as <code>inkel</code> (all lowercase). I work as a software developer at <a href="https://theorem.co/">Theorem</a>, mostly doing backend programming but also dabbling in operations when needed. I&rsquo;m interested in programming as a science, machine learning, DevOps (whatever that means), and keeping systems running.</p>
<h2 id="what-hardware-do-you-use">What hardware do you use?</h2>
<p>My main machine is a MacBook Pro 2015 15&quot;, which I love. I&rsquo;ve also have a secondary Dell XPS with Windows 10. Meh.</p>
<p>I, like everyone else, do not like the new butterfly keyboard, and because of that I&rsquo;m using a <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=31063869554777">Keychron K2</a> as an external, mechanical keyboard; I love this keyboard, it&rsquo;s clickly but not too loud, it can connect to up to 3 devices and seamlessly change from one to the other by pressing a couple keys. The only thing I miss in this keyboard is a Touch ID reader.</p>
<p>For a long while my hands travelled from the K2 to my MBP touchpad, and that was becoming tedious. I love the touchpad, but buying an external one was costly in Argentina, and thus I bought a trackball for the first time in my life, as I also wanted to give them a try. I&rsquo;ve got a <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse">Logitech Ergo MX</a> and boy am I happy with it. It didn&rsquo;t take me too long to get used to it, and while it&rsquo;s not the same as the touchpad, it is customizable so I can do many things without leaving my hand off the trackball. Still, I would like for it to have a couple more buttons so I can customize it even more.</p>
<p>As I work in a 100% remote company, calls are something that happen almost daily. For that reason I use mostly <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-with-35-mm-headphone-plug?fnode=2c1575ea1bbc6149fd197f885aa3792697d9f7902bff43198ab0e2ad4e045a31f2655938f05ab9b762b2afaf7ae7a9a74fb76b395966a5dc75bdda9d264a13ec932f3314d587e3a53d5a875498bfa64299a2338ed3cbce9f57fe6fe6f7e2794e8da738bd0d992e8f071f34bec2717a306c59d8ccbcb69f0d46b8a2c41ddd4e80">Apple EarPods</a>, they work just great. At my office I&rsquo;ve a pair of <a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-audio/g533-wireless-gaming-headset.html">Logitech G533</a>, which sounds great and are wonderful, but have two main issues to my taste: 1. they are not Bluetooth, you need a USB receptor connected to your computer; 2. after 15 minutes of audio silence (i.e. no audio coming through the speakers), it powers off, which is troublesome if you are doing a presentation and the rest of the audience is muted; I&rsquo;ve already felt the pain of talking and talking and talking and people trying to tell me they couldn&rsquo;t hear me but I couldn&rsquo;t hear them either because the headset was off. Sad emoji. I&rsquo;ve also bought a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-SHB3075-Wireless-Headphones-Playtime/dp/B07P8R3CTB">Philips SHB3075</a>, they are comfortable and 100% Bluetooth, but for some reason they don&rsquo;t work well with my MBP, so I&rsquo;ve them paired with my iPhone.</p>
<p>When mobile I use an iPhone 8, one that needs a change because my screen shattered. I started using iPhones since the iPhone 5 and never looked back. They are fast, pretty, and just work, as anything from Apple. Are they expensive? Yes. Are they worth it? Hell yes.</p>
<p>I prefer reading physical books than ebooks, nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve an iPad Mini mostly for just that. It&rsquo;s a great device with an excellent size for reading and taking from one place to another, without being a fullsized iPad.</p>
<p>Last but not least, as a developer I spend most of my days sitting, and I&rsquo;m over 40, so a good chair is more than just luxury. Because of that I own a <a href="https://www.erasmo.com.ar/productos/sillas/operativas/onix/">Erasmo Onix</a>, and my life (and back) has been happier ever since. I cannot stress enough how much I recommend to <strong>spend serious money on a good chair</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="and-what-software">And what software?</h2>
<p>On my main computer, macOS as the operative system. It&rsquo;s pretty, it works, it makes me happy. But I know I&rsquo;ve to upgrade to Catalina soon.</p>
<p>Given I&rsquo;m a developer, most of the things I write happens in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>. My <a href="https://github.com/inkel/emacs-d"><code>init.el</code></a> is far from perfect and I&rsquo;ve neglected updating it for a long time. Sometimes I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> (VSCode) or <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/">Visual Studio for Mac</a>, but I always end up coming back to Emacs.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not on Emacs, I spend most of my time in a few <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> tabs. I&rsquo;ve tried other terminals like <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a>, and while much faster, it&rsquo;s definitely nowhere near in UX. Besides using tabs I also use <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> a lot. A LOT. My <a href="https://github.com/inkel/dotfiles/blob/master/tmux.conf"><code>tmux.conf</code></a> is adequately updated to my tastes, although it could use some improvement. Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard about iTerm and tmux integration; no I haven&rsquo;t tried it. I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a>. I&rsquo;m super comfortable with it, so I&rsquo;m not looking to change to another shell in the short term.</p>
<p>Writing Markdown is something I find myself doing every so often, and for that, I use <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a>. It&rsquo;s beautiful, elegant, fast, I love it. I <strong>might</strong> switch to <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a>, though, as I&rsquo;ve been trying it on my cellphone and it works really well, even without the Pro features; I might upgrade to Pro soon, still haven&rsquo;t decided. This blog is using Typora for the content and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> as the static site generator.</p>
<p>My other computer runs Windows 10. Windows as an operating system has improved a lot over the years, but it&rsquo;s still, in my opinion, not very developer friendly as an operating system. For writing code, <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio</a> is undoubtedly one of the best IDEs there is, although of course mostly tied to developing within the Microsoft platform. I also have VSCode installed: sometimes I just need something that loads fast for quick edits. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15">SQL Server Management Studio</a> is another great tool though it feels a bit dated.
CLI is where I feel Windows fails the most, and while the new <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-1-0/">Windows Terminal</a> looks promising, it still lacks the smooth UX that other terminal emulators like iTerm2 have. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> (WSL) is another great addition to CLI on Windows, but again, still a bit clunky.</p>
<p>Languages are varied: I really enjoy writing <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, love toying with <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, have enough fun to work with <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/">.NET Core</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">C#</a>. I like to have as much infrastructure as possible described using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>. And I really, really love writing scripts using Bash, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">AWK</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html">sed</a>, <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>, and <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least is The Cloud. Nothing surprising there: <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for <a href="https://github.com/inkel">own and Open Source code</a>, and some work related stuff. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> and <a href="https://azure.com/">Microsoft Azure</a> for hosting stuff.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-be-your-dream-setup">What would be your dream setup?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get my hands on one of the newer <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/">MacBook Pro 16&quot;</a> with at least 32 GB of RAM and an SSD of at elast 1TB. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to try a new mechanical keyboard for the time being, but the <a href="https://www.keychron.com/pages/keychron-k8-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K8</a> looks like a good future replacement. Similar with my mouse, I&rsquo;ll continue with my Logitech Ergo MX, but also looking forward to get an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRMF2/magic-trackpad-2-space-gray">Apple Magic Trackpad 2</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to improve my communications setup, probably by getting some <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWP22/airpods-pro">AirPods Pro</a>, or a cool Bluetooth headset.</p>
<p>My office needs some love, and due to the Covid-19 pandemic I&rsquo;m not even going, but once back I&rsquo;d like to have one or two external monitors, and a good microphone. I don&rsquo;t have anything in mind yet, though.</p>
<p>As said my phone needs a change, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to buying an iPhone 11. I&rsquo;d also like to leave my computer at the office but still having something portable and comfortable at home where I can do some coding, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve an <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> in mind.</p>
<p>I want to have my office devices accessible from home, and thus I&rsquo;m looking at using <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>. I&rsquo;ve only heard amazing things about them.</p>
