As with everything, in hindsight, the solution is obvious now. Not that while the problems were similar, both solutions are quite different, and I think they showcase my improvement with the language and functional way of thinking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to Day 2 challenges, and I hope to solve them in less than four days!</p>
