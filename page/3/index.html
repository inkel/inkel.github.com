  <section class="content">
    <p>After publishing my previous <a href="/posts/typical-workday-at-theorem/"><em>Working at Theorem: a typical workday</em></a> article a co-worker asked me the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you go into the details of what happens during those &ldquo;work&rdquo; blocks? Do you frequently check slack_email or only check them occasionally? Are you heads down for parts of the day? Do you have dedicated &ldquo;help_review others&rdquo; time or does it happen ad-hoc?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting question, so here are the answers.</p>
<h2 id="checking-email--slack">Checking email / Slack</h2>
<p>I approach these two differently. Email is something I check only when I don’t have any other task or when I’m in a break. I don’t have alerts or notifications when a new email arrives, so it’s a task that only happens in an active way. I consider email as the best asynchronous communication tool available, thus I treat it that way. I’ve several different filters that labels or archives emails as they arrive so when I check them I don’t have to lose precious time triaging everything that I’ve received.</p>
<p>Of course working 100% asynchronously is an utopia when working in a team that interacts with an external customer, so synchronous communication is a must; at work we use Slack for this. I’ve enabled notifications although I’ve also muted several channels that only generate noise or are mostly for announcements. I could leave those muted channels, however they are still important and I check them a few times throughout the day, usually after catching up with email.</p>
<p>I try to be conscious of how much affects others when mentioning them on Slack, so I try to keep usage of <code>@here</code> at a minimum, <code>@channel</code> only when it is <strong>urgent or very important</strong>; using <code>@everyone</code> is completely off the table, unless a catastrophe happens.
And when it comes to direct messages I always try to send initially only one message: a greeting plus whatever question or comment I’d like to communicate; this way the other person can quickly decide to dedicate some time to me or not.</p>
<h2 id="code-reviews">Code reviews</h2>
<p>A big part of my day consists of reviewing pull requests created by other members of the team. I’m not going to go into the details of how you should behave when doing PR reviews, there are already hundred of posts dedicated to that: this is how I approach this task, YMMV.</p>
<p>First I start by reading the title and description. If those are good and informative then I’d approach the review in a better mood: good programming is mostly about communication, so I held prose to the same standards as code.</p>
<p>Second I look at each commit individually. Writing clear and well scoped commits makes reviewing easier, as you can better understand the author’s intentions. PRs with just one or two gigantic commits are a bummer and from time to time I try and teach people to write smaller commits next time.</p>
<p>Last but not least I look at the code in detail. The first things I look for is overall structure: is the code properly indented or doesn’t violate the rules and standards set for the project? Then I look at the semantics, trying to understand each decision, expecting to see well named variables and methods, easy to follow flow control statements, etc. I can be very nit picky at times, so I have to keep me at bay of not becoming an asshole. And yet there are times when you need to become one; luckily is not something that I need to do often.</p>
<p>PR reviewing is an opportunity for both the author and the reviewer’s growth as programmers and communicators. Treat it like as a learning experience and not as a chore.</p>
<h2 id="time-management">Time management</h2>
<p>With the current pandemic my working conditions changed quite a bit, even when I was already working remotely. The biggest change was on time management. When I worked from my office, I had some dedicated time for things like checking emails and Slack, for deeply diving into any tasks I was working on, and for reviewing code. Now those dedicated time chunks are gone, so I try to manage my time as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking emails and Slack is something I do first thing in the morning, before and after lunch, and during any coffee- or cigarette-break;</li>
<li>Working on assigned tasks in 20 minutes chunks. Nowadays is hard to find long stretch hours of work, 20 minutes is a good compromise between <em>I want to do something</em> and <em>gonna check the kids, have a break</em>.</li>
<li>PR reviews: I usually do them after the above mentioned 20 minutes. In the past I also scheduled this way, but after 40 minutes/1 hour instead.</li>
<li>Lunchtime is something I’ve cleared out in my calendar, daily from noon to 1pm, so we have some routine for the kids. This I try to keep on schedule, so it doesn’t conflicts with my calendar. Of course it doesn’t always happens but so far it hasn’t been a problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="endnotes">Endnotes</h2>
<p>As you can see I haven’t shared any truth revealing insights, though I hope it helps others getting more organized. This schema works for me; it might work for you or don’t work at all.</p>

  <section class="content">
    <p>Last week I was tasked with migrating a DNS zone from DNSimple to AWS Route53. Overall it was pretty straightforward except when I had to migrate two <code>ALIAS</code> records. This is a special type of record that’s not part of the DNS specification, so there was no direct alternative.</p>
<h2 id="subdomain">Subdomain</h2>
<p>Say that you have a subdomain <code>www.example.com</code> that was using an <code>ALIAS</code> record pointing to <code>www.example.net</code>. This is by far the easiest to move, as it implies replacing the <code>TXT</code> record defining the alias for a <code>CNAME</code>.</p>
<h2 id="apex-domain">Apex domain</h2>
<p>This is were it gets complicated. If you had an <code>ALIAS</code> for <code>example.com</code> to <code>example.net</code> you cannot replace it with a <code>CNAME</code>, because apex domains do not support that. The solution is to use an <code>A</code> record, which loses the value of an alias you would need to keep updating the IP address of the destination of it ever changes.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>As you can see it’s not that complicated to migrate ALIAS records to AWS Route53, however, they do have some limitations. I’ve went from this</p>
<pre><code>www.example.com. 3600 IN TXT &quot;ALIAS for example.net&quot;
example.com.     3600 IN TXT &quot;ALIAS for example.net&quot;
</code></pre><p>to this</p>
<pre><code>www.example.com.    3600    IN  CNAME   example.net.
example.net.        3600    IN  A       192.168.14.52
</code></pre><p>and achieved the expected results, though we now need to keep an eye on the IP address of the destination.</p>

  <section class="content">
    <p>I&rsquo;ve joined <del>Citrusbyte</del><a href="https://theorem.co/">Theorem</a> 9 years ago, and since day 1 it was a fully remote experience. Over the years I&rsquo;ve learned lots about how to organize myself to approach each new workday although never gave much thought to it, until a few days ago, when while interviewing a candidate he asked <em>what does a typical day at Theorem looks like</em>. This post will try to address that question.</p>
<p>First and foremost, a disclaimer: by no means I speak on behalf of Theorem or the rest of my teammates; these are entirely my own experiences and do not reflect the reality of all the great people working at this company.</p>
<p>I live with my girlfriend and our two lovely kids (4 years old and 1 year and a half), so keep that in mind while reading this post.</p>
<p>As you are aware, at the time of writing this post we are living in very strange times, throughout a global pandemic that has most of the world in quarantine with people confined to their places and working remotely. As stated earlier, at Theorem we are 100% remote since the beginning, so the COVID-19 pandemic didn&rsquo;t change much on how we work, although it had some effects.</p>
<h2 id="pre-pandemic-typical-workday">Pre-pandemic typical workday</h2>
<p>I have an office 20 blocks away from home, and my kids went to kindergarten 4 blocks away from the office, so days started at 6:15 am to enjoy breakfast with the family, then we would drive the kids to school, drop them and head to the office. My workdays usually started, then, at 8:00 am.</p>
<figure class="photo"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/inkel/49831040487/in/dateposted/">
    <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49831040487_a6ce2c02ea.jpg"/> </a><figcaption>
            <h4>Office</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The very first thing I usually do any given day is going through my emails and any pending notification from the day before. If something requires my attention immediately I answer right at it, otherwise, I either archive or snooze the message to a later time if required.</p>
<p>Next is checking the status of any ongoing task I have been working previously, and paving the way for what&rsquo;s next. Then, off to work.</p>
<p>Around noon either myself or my girlfriend goes to pick up the kids from school, and takes them home to have lunch, and then back to the office. If I&rsquo;m the one picking them, I do that during my lunch break, and then have a quick bite or snack. Otherwise, I cook something for myself or order some delivery. During this break I might read or watch something.</p>
<p>Then the rest of the day goes on, until 4:00 pm or 5:00 pm, depending on the day, and walk back home. And that concludes a typical workday.</p>
<h2 id="typical-workday-during-the-pandemic">Typical workday during the pandemic</h2>
<p>Things have changed, clearly. We don&rsquo;t wake up anymore at 6:15 am, now it&rsquo;s usually at around 8:00 am. Breakfast is served, and I use this time to catch up on some news and go through my emails and notifications, again snoozing for an hour or so whatever needs my attention; the rest is archived.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set up a standing desk in my bedroom, which is right next to the living room, where the kids spend most of their time playing. The biggest change since the pandemic was that nowadays I don&rsquo;t have long stretches of work time anymore, so I try and split my tasks into smaller time schedules, so I can take a look at my kids, play with them or help them with homework (yes, even my 1.5 years old daughter has Zoom meetings now.)</p>

  <figcaption>
    <h4>Working from home with kids</h4>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Lunch and dinner are usually planned the night before, so at around noon either me or my girlfriend starts preparing lunch. The kids love this time as they get to watch something on Netflix. I had to cancel all my meetings during this time, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to have affected my work. Asynchronous communication works great!</p>
<p>After lunch work continues, and I might be able to get some work-only hours if the kids decide to nap, otherwise, again it&rsquo;s split into smaller chunks of time. Either way, I&rsquo;m still able to drive my commitments to success.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>As you can see, not much has changed, other than how many hours in stretch I can work without interruptions. All other work details were already in place given that we are a 100% remote company. The biggest takeaway, for me, is that in order to survive this crazy new world we are living in, you need to work with great people, who understand not all experiences are equal, who trust you will work with professionalism and responsibility, and who you trust back in the same way.</p>

    <p>If you are like me you might have used the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/sort"><code>sort(1)</code></a> CLI utility more than once in your life. Today, I&rsquo;ve found a trick that I&rsquo;ve never used before, and hopefully it will help someone else in the future.</p>
<p>Say that we have the following file to sort:</p>
<pre><code>fpdy 01 08 wcfo
juvi 01 02 ejan
urbx 04 03 ckbw
fkzq 01 08 myaz
fjie 04 09 rhvo
almv 04 02 adhs
cuah 07 04 gbyt
chok 09 06 nqwo
emjd 01 04 ledx
npto 02 10 nqsc
</code></pre><p>Now, supposed that I wanted to sort first by the third column and then for the second one, then one would do <code>sort -k 3 foo.txt</code>. Easy. But what if instead the source file looked like this and I wanted the same results?</p>
<pre><code>fpdy 0108 wcfo
juvi 0102 ejan
urbx 0403 ckbw
fkzq 0108 myaz
fjie 0409 rhvo
almv 0402 adhs
cuah 0704 gbyt
chok 0906 nqwo
emjd 0104 ledx
npto 0210 nqsc
</code></pre><p>Well, tricky, right? Not really: the <code>-k</code> accepts the format <code>F[.C]</code>, where <code>F</code> is the field number (<code>2</code> in our case) and <code>C</code> is the character position within the field (<code>4</code> in our case) so if we run the following we will achieve what we are looking for:</p>
<pre><code>$ sort -k 2.4 foo.txt
almv 0402 adhs
juvi 0102 ejan
urbx 0403 ckbw
cuah 0704 gbyt
emjd 0104 ledx
chok 0906 nqwo
fkzq 0108 myaz
fpdy 0108 wcfo
fjie 0409 rhvo
npto 0210 nqsc
</code></pre><p>Why <code>4</code> and not <code>3</code>, I don&rsquo;t know, but I think it&rsquo;s taking the separator into account. I need to investigate more. But so far I haven&rsquo;t the need to do something as fine-grained as this, so I can still sleep well at night.</p>

    <p>If there&rsquo;s one piece of technology I&rsquo;ve come to love and depend upon these last years it definitely is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>. Sadly, the only provider that seems to be complete is the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html">AWS provider</a>, but others seems to be missing some useful resources or data sources. As an example, these past days at <a href="https://www.citrusbyte.com/">work</a> I had to work with the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html">Azure provider</a> and found that I was really missing the ability to query <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a> for <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/">Virtual Machine</a> IDs, but there wasn&rsquo;t a data source for this, and I didn&rsquo;t want to <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html">import</a> the virtual machines we&rsquo;ve already created (insert <em>long story</em> reasons here).</p>
<p>But then I remember that Terraform and its providers are written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, so I took it to add the resource myself.</p>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t about how to write providers, the folks at Hashicorp already wrote a guide to <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/writing-custom-providers.html">write custom providers</a> which is pretty useful. But I&rsquo;ve found that there was something missing, or that I didn&rsquo;t fully understood, and that was <em>how can I test my changes are working?</em>.</p>
<p>Most if not all providers have unit and acceptance tests that allow to test that the changes we introduced work as expected, which are great for once you want to send a pull request, but I am the type of programmer that likes to try things in the <em>Real World™</em> before going into the TDD workflow, so I fired up my editor and start hacking on adding a new data source that would allow me to query a virtual machine ID by name. After a few tries, I&rsquo;ve got something that looked about right, but then the question came: how do I test it? If I run <code>terraform init</code> it uses the published provider, which obviously doesn&rsquo;t have the changes I made. I&rsquo;ve found in the documentation some references as to where can you place <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#third-party-plugins">third-party providers</a> on your machine for testing, but that didn&rsquo;t really work as it was missing, IMO, some information. Luckily, I&rsquo;ve found some pointers in another document that explains how <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/how-terraform-works.html#discovery">Terraform works</a>, but that was still missing some information. After a while, I&rsquo;ve found the solution, and here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git clone <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm">Azure Terraform provider source code</a>.</li>
<li>Make the changes.</li>
<li>Run <code>go build</code>. This will generate a <code>terraform-provider-azurerm</code> executable in your current directory.</li>
<li>Move the executable to the discovery folder: <code>mv terraform-provider-azurerm ~/.terraform.d/plugins/darwin_amd64/</code></li>
<li>Go to a folder with some Terraform configuration that uses the Azure provider.</li>
<li>Remove the cached version: <code>rm -rv .terraform/plugins/</code> (this will remove all plugins, but don&rsquo;t worry)</li>
<li>Run <code>terraform init</code></li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I can test my changes with a live Terraform configuration.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve came across the following tweet the other day, and I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/P3BbFqx1ro">https://t.co/P3BbFqx1ro</a> CURLOPT_HAPROXYPROTOCOL: support the HAProxy PROXY protocol<br><br>Add --haproxy-protocol for the command line tool<br><br>Cl...</p>&mdash; curl commits (@curlcommits) <a href="https://twitter.com/curlcommits/status/974961166807109633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>This is exciting to me as the work I&rsquo;ve been doing in <a href="https://github.com/inkel/viaproxy"><code>viaproxy</code></a> had one caveat: testing it works was a bit convoluted, as I was doing by running an <a href="https://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a> instance with a custom configuration like the following:</p>
<pre><code>global
    debug
    maxconn 4000
    log 127.0.0.1 local0

defaults
    timeout connect 10s
    timeout client  1m
    timeout server  1m

listen without-send-proxy
    mode tcp
    log global
    option tcplog
    bind *:17654
    server app1 127.0.0.1:7655

listen with-send-proxy
    mode tcp
    log global
    option tcplog
    bind *:27654
    bind ipv6@:27654
    server app1 127.0.0.1:7654 send-proxy
</code></pre><p>Luckily commit <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/6baeb6df35d24740c55239f24b5fc4ce86f375a5"><code>6baeb6df</code></a> adds a new <code>--haproxy-protocol</code> that, as documented, will do the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Send a HAProxy PROXY protocol header at the beginning of the connection. This is used by some load balancers and reverse proxies to indicate the client&rsquo;s true IP address and port.</p>
<p>This option is primarily useful when sending test requests to a service that expects this header.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading the commit changes is very enlightening, too, as it is a great example of nice and simple C code. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the release!</p>

    <p>Today <a href="https://chadoh.com/">Chad Ostrowski</a>, a fellow engineer at <a href="https://citrusbyte.com/">Citrusbyte</a>, shared an article he wrote: <a href="https://medium.com/@chadoh/css-pro-tips-responsive-font-sizes-and-when-to-use-which-units-d005486985ec">CSS pro tips: responsive font-sizes and when to use which units</a>. After reading it, I couldn&rsquo;t help myself and adapted some of the tips there to this site. It&rsquo;s now much easier to maintain, I think, as I&rsquo;ve removed all previous media queries, but I had to add one:</p>

    <p>Say you have a private key in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail">PEM format</a>, and you want to use that key for SSH into another server, by adding an entry to your <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file with the public key of such PEM file. The following command will parse your PEM file and output the required RSA format used in <code>authorized_keys</code>:</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -y -f path/to/file.pem
</code></pre><p>This will output a <code>ssh-rsa AAAA…</code> string that is safe to append to your <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. The <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen"><code>ssh-keygen</code></a> uses the <code>-f</code> flag to specify the input file name, and the <code>-y</code> flag to read a private file and output the OpenSSH public key to standard output.</p>

    <p>Today <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/">Thorsten Ball</a> asked a simple question on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Does something like a reverse-curl exist? A tool that allows me to listen on a socket and return one HTTP response?</p>&mdash; Thorsten Ball (@thorstenball) <a href="https://twitter.com/thorstenball/status/923890186479656960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>After a brief exchange of tweets, I said:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Or we could write one in Go 😺</p>&mdash; Lean (inkel) (@inkel) <a href="https://twitter.com/inkel/status/923896402056499200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Twenty minutes later <a href="https://github.com/inkel/lruc"><code>lruc</code></a> was born.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh wow! :)</p>&mdash; Thorsten Ball (@thorstenball) <a href="https://twitter.com/thorstenball/status/923901953821872128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s still very fresh and missing many features, but basically it is a web server that allows you to configure it to always respond with a custom response without too much hassle. The usage is very simple:</p>
<pre><code>Usage of lruc:
  -addr string
        Address to listen for requests (default &quot;:8080&quot;)
  -body -
        Response body. Use - to read from a stdin (default &quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
  -code int
        HTTP response code (default 200)
  -content-type string
        Content-Type (default &quot;text/plain&quot;)
</code></pre><p>Say that you want to create a server that always respond with a <code>404 Not Found</code> and a body of <code>No se pudo encontrar lo que buscaba</code> (Spanish for <em>Couldn&rsquo;t find what you were looking for</em> (sort of)) on port 7070, then you could execute the following:</p>
<pre><code>lruc -addr :7070 -code 404 -body &quot;No se pudo encontrar lo que buscaba&quot;
</code></pre><p>Or say that you want to always return an image, then you could do something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt; image.png lruc -content-type image/png -body -

<span class="c1"># Or in an useless use of cat</span>
cat image.png <span class="p">|</span> lruc -content-type image/png -body -
</code></pre></div><p>This seems like an interesting tool to keep working on, so watch <a href="https://github.com/inkel/lruc"><code>github.com/inkel/lruc</code></a> for updates.</p>
<p>PS: did I said already that I love Go?</p>

    <p>Ever happened to you that you wanted to know which SSH key you need to connect to an AWS EC2 instance? I always found that the fingerprints don&rsquo;t tell me much, espcially because I always forget how to compute the fingerprints. Good that I&rsquo;m back to writing, so I&rsquo;m dumping my memory here:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the key was generated by AWS, then use <code>openssl pkcs8 -in path/to/key.pem -nocrypt -topk8 -outform DER | openssl sha1 -c</code></li>
<li>if the key was generated using <code>ssh-keygen</code> then use <code>openssl rsa -in path/to/private/key -pubout -outform DER | openssl md5 -c</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Why does AWS uses one format and why SSH other? Escapes my current knowledge.</p>
