    <p>I&rsquo;m on a roll! Day 1 was <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode2020-day1/">painful</a>; in day 2 I did some <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode2020-day2/">improvements</a>, and now <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/5bbf796dba907e708ed3a68874bfaa12745d5bb6/src/adventofcode_2020/day3.clj">day 3 was also solved</a> in less than 2 hours!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting more familiar with Clojure, and the tools I use for this project: <a href="https://leiningen.org">Leiningen</a>, Emacs + <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a>. About the latter, I know I could be more efficient if I knew the commands better, but so far it is really useful and I&rsquo;m not only learning tons but also in awe as to how well integrated this tool is.</p>

    <p>Funny how <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode2020-day1/">day 1 took me 4 days to solve</a> but I was able to <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/bc2b6ef16bcf6b7e7425702f1732c67a1da9387e/src/adventofcode_2020/day2.clj">solve day 2</a> in just an hour.

<p>I also like that I think my Clojure programming style is getting better as the time passes, which in the end was my sole main objective.</p>

    <p>I did it! I was finally to solve both <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/e80cb5b5be71002516c89e95dc86bd857e678eec/src/adventofcode_2020/day1.clj">Day 1 challenges in Clojure</a>! And it only took me four days!</p>
<p>As said in my <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode-2020/">previous post</a> one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m participating in this years <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent of Code</a> is because I want to learn <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, and while at times I felt frustrated because I couldn&rsquo;t find the solution, I&rsquo;m happy that I did. As with everything, in hindsight, the solution is obvious now. Not that while the problems were similar, both solutions are quite different, and I think they showcase my improvement with the language and functional way of thinking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to Day 2 challenges, and I hope to solve them in less than four days!</p>

    <p>For years I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the idea behind <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a variety of reasons I&rsquo;ve neglected participating in <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/events">past editions</a>, but this year I&rsquo;ve finally decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>The biggest reason behind the decision to join this year was that for the longest time I had the desire to become proficient in any of the many LISP languages out there, particularly in <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, so I saw this as a chance to get more familiar with it, learn something more about it, and having fun while doing so.</p>
<p>There are already 2 puzzles going on, and I haven&rsquo;t even started, but when I do I also plan to publish everything into my <a href="https://github.com/inkel/">GitHub account</a>.</p>

    <p>One thing I like to do is collect links for reading later, and let&rsquo;s be honest, who hasn&rsquo;t? I also usually share some interesting links with folks at work, where I made myself the fame as the <em>links provider</em>. So that got me thinking: why not creating a newsletter where I can share these links with a broader audience? So thank you to <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a> I now have a newsletter for you: <a href="https://buttondown.email/inkel">inkelinks</a>.</p>
<p>Besides the newsletter I&rsquo;ll be posting the links on this blog too, for those who prefer it that way. But I suggest using the form below so you don&rsquo;t miss any weekly links!</p>

    <p>For years I disliked playing games. Never before in my life I had a gaming console, and the last game I played from start to end was The Secret of Monkey Island. But a couple of years ago I decided to buy a PlayStation 4 and I&rsquo;m extremely happy with that decision. The main reason was of course to start playing myself, but also to raise my kids in a house where gaming is &ldquo;normal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Why did I wait so long?!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a hardcore gamer, not even close, but since I bought my PS4 I play at least one hour almost every night, as a way of cooling off my mind before going to bed. I find it very relaxing and entertaining. I mostly play solo games, the idea of working online with others doesn&rsquo;t attract me, as I take this time as a <em>me time</em> and I don&rsquo;t want to engage with others. I know that I&rsquo;m missing lots of fun, or so I&rsquo;ve been told, but I&rsquo;m happy with this decision.</p>
<p>Over the course of the upcoming months I&rsquo;ll try and leave some &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; on some of the games I played so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizon: Zero Dawn</li>
<li>God of War</li>
<li>Uncharted Saga</li>
<li>The WItcher 3</li>
<li>Detroit: Becoming Human</li>
<li>Mass Effect: Andromeda</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Rise of the Tomb Raider</li>
<li>The Last of Us</li>
<li>Dragon Age: Inquisition</li>
</ul>
<p>I cannot finish this post without saying this: the very first game I played, <a href="https://www.guerrilla-games.com/play/horizon">Horizon: Zero Dawn</a>, I fell in love with the character, the world, and the story behind it:</p>

    <p>I always liked the interviews at <a href="https://usesthis.com/">Uses This</a>, I find it really interesting knowing other people&rsquo;s setups. And given that I do not foresee them interviewing me anytime soon, I went ahead and wrote my own.</p>
<h2 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you, and what do you do?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m Leandro López, better known on the Internet as <code>inkel</code> (all lowercase). I work as a software developer at <a href="https://theorem.co/">Theorem</a>, mostly doing backend programming but also dabbling in operations when needed. I&rsquo;m interested in programming as a science, machine learning, DevOps (whatever that means), and keeping systems running.</p>
<h2 id="what-hardware-do-you-use">What hardware do you use?</h2>
<p>My main machine is a MacBook Pro 2015 15&quot;, which I love. I&rsquo;ve also have a secondary Dell XPS with Windows 10. Meh.</p>
<p>I, like everyone else, do not like the new butterfly keyboard, and because of that I&rsquo;m using a <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=31063869554777">Keychron K2</a> as an external, mechanical keyboard; I love this keyboard, it&rsquo;s clickly but not too loud, it can connect to up to 3 devices and seamlessly change from one to the other by pressing a couple keys. The only thing I miss in this keyboard is a Touch ID reader.</p>
<p>For a long while my hands travelled from the K2 to my MBP touchpad, and that was becoming tedious. I love the touchpad, but buying an external one was costly in Argentina, and thus I bought a trackball for the first time in my life, as I also wanted to give them a try. I&rsquo;ve got a <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse">Logitech Ergo MX</a> and boy am I happy with it. It didn&rsquo;t take me too long to get used to it, and while it&rsquo;s not the same as the touchpad, it is customizable so I can do many things without leaving my hand off the trackball. Still, I would like for it to have a couple more buttons so I can customize it even more.</p>
<p>As I work in a 100% remote company, calls are something that happen almost daily. For that reason I use mostly <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-with-35-mm-headphone-plug?fnode=2c1575ea1bbc6149fd197f885aa3792697d9f7902bff43198ab0e2ad4e045a31f2655938f05ab9b762b2afaf7ae7a9a74fb76b395966a5dc75bdda9d264a13ec932f3314d587e3a53d5a875498bfa64299a2338ed3cbce9f57fe6fe6f7e2794e8da738bd0d992e8f071f34bec2717a306c59d8ccbcb69f0d46b8a2c41ddd4e80">Apple EarPods</a>, they work just great. At my office I&rsquo;ve a pair of <a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-audio/g533-wireless-gaming-headset.html">Logitech G533</a>, which sounds great and are wonderful, but have two main issues to my taste: 1. they are not Bluetooth, you need a USB receptor connected to your computer; 2. after 15 minutes of audio silence (i.e. no audio coming through the speakers), it powers off, which is troublesome if you are doing a presentation and the rest of the audience is muted; I&rsquo;ve already felt the pain of talking and talking and talking and people trying to tell me they couldn&rsquo;t hear me but I couldn&rsquo;t hear them either because the headset was off. Sad emoji. I&rsquo;ve also bought a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-SHB3075-Wireless-Headphones-Playtime/dp/B07P8R3CTB">Philips SHB3075</a>, they are comfortable and 100% Bluetooth, but for some reason they don&rsquo;t work well with my MBP, so I&rsquo;ve them paired with my iPhone.</p>
<p>When mobile I use an iPhone 8, one that needs a change because my screen shattered. I started using iPhones since the iPhone 5 and never looked back. They are fast, pretty, and just work, as anything from Apple. Are they expensive? Yes. Are they worth it? Hell yes.</p>
<p>I prefer reading physical books than ebooks, nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve an iPad Mini mostly for just that. It&rsquo;s a great device with an excellent size for reading and taking from one place to another, without being a fullsized iPad.</p>
<p>Last but not least, as a developer I spend most of my days sitting, and I&rsquo;m over 40, so a good chair is more than just luxury. Because of that I own a <a href="https://www.erasmo.com.ar/productos/sillas/operativas/onix/">Erasmo Onix</a>, and my life (and back) has been happier ever since. I cannot stress enough how much I recommend to <strong>spend serious money on a good chair</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="and-what-software">And what software?</h2>
<p>On my main computer, macOS as the operative system. It&rsquo;s pretty, it works, it makes me happy. But I know I&rsquo;ve to upgrade to Catalina soon.</p>
<p>Given I&rsquo;m a developer, most of the things I write happens in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>. My <a href="https://github.com/inkel/emacs-d"><code>init.el</code></a> is far from perfect and I&rsquo;ve neglected updating it for a long time. Sometimes I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> (VSCode) or <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/">Visual Studio for Mac</a>, but I always end up coming back to Emacs.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not on Emacs, I spend most of my time in a few <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> tabs. I&rsquo;ve tried other terminals like <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a>, and while much faster, it&rsquo;s definitely nowhere near in UX. Besides using tabs I also use <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> a lot. A LOT. My <a href="https://github.com/inkel/dotfiles/blob/master/tmux.conf"><code>tmux.conf</code></a> is adequately updated to my tastes, although it could use some improvement. Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard about iTerm and tmux integration; no I haven&rsquo;t tried it. I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a>. I&rsquo;m super comfortable with it, so I&rsquo;m not looking to change to another shell in the short term.</p>
<p>Writing Markdown is something I find myself doing every so often, and for that, I use <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a>. It&rsquo;s beautiful, elegant, fast, I love it. I <strong>might</strong> switch to <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a>, though, as I&rsquo;ve been trying it on my cellphone and it works really well, even without the Pro features; I might upgrade to Pro soon, still haven&rsquo;t decided. This blog is using Typora for the content and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> as the static site generator.</p>
<p>My other computer runs Windows 10. Windows as an operating system has improved a lot over the years, but it&rsquo;s still, in my opinion, not very developer friendly as an operating system. For writing code, <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio</a> is undoubtedly one of the best IDEs there is, although of course mostly tied to developing within the Microsoft platform. I also have VSCode installed: sometimes I just need something that loads fast for quick edits. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15">SQL Server Management Studio</a> is another great tool though it feels a bit dated.
CLI is where I feel Windows fails the most, and while the new <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-1-0/">Windows Terminal</a> looks promising, it still lacks the smooth UX that other terminal emulators like iTerm2 have. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> (WSL) is another great addition to CLI on Windows, but again, still a bit clunky.</p>
<p>Languages are varied: I really enjoy writing <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, love toying with <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, have enough fun to work with <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/">.NET Core</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">C#</a>. I like to have as much infrastructure as possible described using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>. And I really, really love writing scripts using Bash, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">AWK</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html">sed</a>, <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>, and <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>.</p>
<p>Last but not least is The Cloud. Nothing surprising there: <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for <a href="https://github.com/inkel">own and Open Source code</a>, and some work related stuff. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> and <a href="https://azure.com/">Microsoft Azure</a> for hosting stuff.</p>
<h2 id="what-would-be-your-dream-setup">What would be your dream setup?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get my hands on one of the newer <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/">MacBook Pro 16&quot;</a> with at least 32 GB of RAM and an SSD of at elast 1TB. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to try a new mechanical keyboard for the time being, but the <a href="https://www.keychron.com/pages/keychron-k8-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K8</a> looks like a good future replacement. Similar with my mouse, I&rsquo;ll continue with my Logitech Ergo MX, but also looking forward to get an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRMF2/magic-trackpad-2-space-gray">Apple Magic Trackpad 2</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to improve my communications setup, probably by getting some <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWP22/airpods-pro">AirPods Pro</a>, or a cool Bluetooth headset.</p>
<p>My office needs some love, and due to the Covid-19 pandemic I&rsquo;m not even going, but once back I&rsquo;d like to have one or two external monitors, and a good microphone. I don&rsquo;t have anything in mind yet, though.</p>
<p>As said my phone needs a change, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to buying an iPhone 11. I&rsquo;d also like to leave my computer at the office but still having something portable and comfortable at home where I can do some coding, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve an <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> in mind.</p>
<p>I want to have my office devices accessible from home, and thus I&rsquo;m looking at using <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a>. I&rsquo;ve only heard amazing things about them.</p>

    <p>I kept forgetting how to perform the equivalent of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html"><code>grep(1)</code></a> in PowerShell. The simple answer is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/select-string?view=powershell-7"><code>Select-String</code></a>. It is aliased to <code>sls</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ipconfig | Select-String 192.168
</code></pre><p>I should probably add a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/24914795">permanent alias</a>.</p>
