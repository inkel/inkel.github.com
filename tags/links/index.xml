      <description>Welcome to the first episode of inkelinks! I hope the title is clear, but in case it doesn’t: this is a collection of links that I’ve found useful, fun, or interesting. I’m planning on releasing a new episode weekly on Fridays at around 14:00 UTC.
Links  Just a bunch of git stuff
I use Git extensively, and I’m quite aware of many of its internals and obscure commands, yet there’s always more things to learn.</description>

      <description>One thing I like to do is collect links for reading later, and let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, who hasn&amp;rsquo;t? I also usually share some interesting links with folks at work, where I made myself the fame as the links provider. So that got me thinking: why not creating a newsletter where I can share these links with a broader audience? So thank you to Buttondown I now have a newsletter for you: inkelinks.</description>
