    <dd>So here I am, once more, trying to have some sort of blog or journal. I&rsquo;ll try to write about interesting pieces of code that I&rsquo;ve written, problems I had to solve, books I&rsquo;ve read (or dropped), et cetera. Don&rsquo;t get your hopes too high, though, I&rsquo;m lazy and tend to forget doing this kind of stuff.</dd>

      <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/typical-workday-at-theorem/">Working at Theorem: a typical day</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>I&rsquo;ve joined CitrusbyteTheorem 9 years ago, and since day 1 it was a fully remote experience. Over the years I&rsquo;ve learned lots about how to organize myself to approach each new workday although never gave much thought to it, until a few days ago, when while interviewing a candidate he asked what does a typical day at Theorem looks like. This post will try to address that question.
First and foremost, a disclaimer: by no means I speak on behalf of Theorem or the rest of my teammates; these are entirely my own experiences and do not reflect the reality of all the great people working at this company.</dd>

    </dt>
    <dd>After publishing my previous Working at Theorem: a typical workday article a co-worker asked me the following:
 Can you go into the details of what happens during those &ldquo;work&rdquo; blocks? Do you frequently check slack_email or only check them occasionally? Are you heads down for parts of the day? Do you have dedicated &ldquo;help_review others&rdquo; time or does it happen ad-hoc?
 This is an interesting question, so here are the answers.</dd>

    </dt>
    <dd>I always liked the interviews at Uses This, I find it really interesting knowing other people&rsquo;s setups. And given that I do not foresee them intereviewing me anytime soon, I went ahead and wrote my own version.
Who are you, and what do you do? I&rsquo;m Leandro LÃ³pez, better known on the Internet as inkel (all lowercase). I work as a software developer at Theorem, mostly doing backend programming but also dabbling in operations when needed.</dd>
