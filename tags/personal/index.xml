      <title>Am I a gamer now?</title>

      <description>For years I disliked playing games. Never before in my life I had a gaming console, and the last game I played from start to end was The Secret of Monkey Island. But a couple of years ago I decided to buy a PlayStation 4 and I&amp;rsquo;m extremely happy with that decision. The main reason was of course to start playing myself, but also to raise my kids in a house where gaming is &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I always liked the interviews at Uses This, I find it really interesting knowing other people&amp;rsquo;s setups. And given that I do not foresee them interviewing me anytime soon, I went ahead and wrote my own.
Who are you, and what do you do? I&amp;rsquo;m Leandro LÃ³pez, better known on the Internet as inkel (all lowercase). I work as a software developer at Theorem, mostly doing backend programming but also dabbling in operations when needed.</description>

      <title>How do I organize my work blocks</title>

      <description>After publishing my previous Working at Theorem: a typical workday article a co-worker asked me the following:
 Can you go into the details of what happens during those &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; blocks? Do you frequently check slack_email or only check them occasionally? Are you heads down for parts of the day? Do you have dedicated &amp;ldquo;help_review others&amp;rdquo; time or does it happen ad-hoc?
 This is an interesting question, so here are the answers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve joined CitrusbyteTheorem 9 years ago, and since day 1 it was a fully remote experience. Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve learned lots about how to organize myself to approach each new workday although never gave much thought to it, until a few days ago, when while interviewing a candidate he asked what does a typical day at Theorem looks like. This post will try to address that question.
First and foremost, a disclaimer: by no means I speak on behalf of Theorem or the rest of my teammates; these are entirely my own experiences and do not reflect the reality of all the great people working at this company.</description>

      <description>So here I am, once more, trying to have some sort of blog or journal. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to write about interesting pieces of code that I&amp;rsquo;ve written, problems I had to solve, books I&amp;rsquo;ve read (or dropped), et cetera. Don&amp;rsquo;t get your hopes too high, though, I&amp;rsquo;m lazy and tend to forget doing this kind of stuff.</description>
