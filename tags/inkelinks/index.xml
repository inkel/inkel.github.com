      <description>Issue #2 of my newsletter was delivered today. I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying curating links and sharing them with friends! In case you missed it, here it is:
Yes! Welcome to a new issue of inkelinks. Last time it was the first one and of course I had a typo on the subject 😞 but all the links were working, so there’s that 💪🏽
In this issue you’ll find the regular links section plus a new Podcast Episode of the Week section where I’ll share a single link to an episode of the many podcasts that I listen to that I think has value for sharing.</description>
