      <description>After publishing my previous Working at Theorem: a typical workday article a co-worker asked me the following:
 Can you go into the details of what happens during those &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; blocks? Do you frequently check slack_email or only check them occasionally? Are you heads down for parts of the day? Do you have dedicated &amp;ldquo;help_review others&amp;rdquo; time or does it happen ad-hoc?
 This is an interesting question, so here are the answers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve joined CitrusbyteTheorem 9 years ago, and since day 1 it was a fully remote experience. Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve learned lots about how to organize myself to approach each new workday although never gave much thought to it, until a few days ago, when while interviewing a candidate he asked what does a typical day at Theorem looks like. This post will try to address that question.
First and foremost, a disclaimer: by no means I speak on behalf of Theorem or the rest of my teammates; these are entirely my own experiences and do not reflect the reality of all the great people working at this company.</description>
