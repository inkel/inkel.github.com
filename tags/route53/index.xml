      <description>Last week I was tasked with migrating a DNS zone from DNSimple to AWS Route53. Overall it was pretty straightforward except when I had to migrate two ALIAS records. This is a special type of record thatâ€™s not part of the DNS specification, so there was no direct alternative.
Subdomain Say that you have a subdomain www.example.com that was using an ALIAS record pointing to www.example.net. This is by far the easiest to move, as it implies replacing the TXT record defining the alias for a CNAME.</description>
