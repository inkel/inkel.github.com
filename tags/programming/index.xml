      <description>I did it! I was finally to solve both Day 1 challenges in Clojure! And it only took me four days!
As said in my previous post one of the reasons why I&amp;rsquo;m participating in this years Advent of Code is because I want to learn Clojure, and while at times I felt frustrated because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the solution, I&amp;rsquo;m happy that I did. As with everything, in hindsight, the solution is obvious now.</description>

      <description>For years I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of the idea behind Advent of Code:
 â€¦an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
 For a variety of reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve neglected participating in past editions, but this year I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to give it a try.
The biggest reason behind the decision to join this year was that for the longest time I had the desire to become proficient in any of the many LISP languages out there, particularly in Clojure, so I saw this as a chance to get more familiar with it, learn something more about it, and having fun while doing so.</description>
