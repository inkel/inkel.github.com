    </dt>
    <dd>For years I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the idea behind Advent of Code:
 …an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
 For a variety of reasons I&rsquo;ve neglected participating in past editions, but this year I&rsquo;ve finally decided to give it a try.
The biggest reason behind the decision to join this year was that for the longest time I had the desire to become proficient in any of the many LISP languages out there, particularly in Clojure, so I saw this as a chance to get more familiar with it, learn something more about it, and having fun while doing so.</dd>

    </dt>
    <dd>I did it! I was finally to solve both Day 1 challenges in Clojure! And it only took me four days!
As said in my previous post one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m participating in this years Advent of Code is because I want to learn Clojure, and while at times I felt frustrated because I couldn&rsquo;t find the solution, I&rsquo;m happy that I did. As with everything, in hindsight, the solution is obvious now.</dd>

    </dt>
    <dd>Funny how day 1 took me 4 days to solve but I was able to solve day 2 in just an hour. I guess the challenges are not strictly in a increasing order of complexity.
I also like that I think my Clojure programming style is getting better as the time passes, which in the end was my sole main objective.
Let’s see what day 3 lies ahead…</dd>

    </dt>
    <dd>I&rsquo;m on a roll! Day 1 was painful; in day 2 I did some improvements, and now day 3 was also solved in less than 2 hours!
I&rsquo;m getting more familiar with Clojure, and the tools I use for this project: Leiningen, Emacs + CIDER. About the latter, I know I could be more efficient if I knew the commands better, but so far it is really useful and I&rsquo;m not only learning tons but also in awe as to how well integrated this tool is.</dd>

      <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode2020-day4/">Advent of Code 2020: Day 4</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>Last night I solved day 4 part 1 of the Advent of Code 2020 challenge, and this morning I finally solved part 2, thus solving day 4 completely. While arguably days 2, 3, and 4 have &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; challenges than day 1, they were still challenging, specially given how unfamiliar I am with Clojure&rsquo;s syntax and API.
I feel more confident as each day passes, and I&rsquo;m getting more proficient with the environment as well.</dd>

    </dt>
    <dd>These day 5 solutions took me a little longer, yet nothing compared to how long it took me when I started with Clojure.
One thing that I always knew theoretically but now I can confirm because of working with it the last few days is that the level of expressiveness is astonishing. I was very comfortable when I was programming in Ruby because I felt that it was too easy to translate my thoughts into code, but I&rsquo;ve got to confess that while I&rsquo;m nowhere near that level of comfort, I&rsquo;m liking it more and more as each day passes.</dd>

    </dt>
    <dd>So far these are the challenges that I liked the most, I think. Also, a feeling that I&rsquo;ve been having lately was that the code is a mess (to be expected because I&rsquo;m learning) and this particular day&rsquo;s solutions showed me exactly that: there are lots of refactorings to apply that will make the code more reusable and maintainable. I don&rsquo;t plan on doing that yet, but it&rsquo;s likely I&rsquo;ll do it in the upcoming days.</dd>

    </dt>
    <dd>I had a very busy couple of days at work, so I couldn&rsquo;t get too much done in Advent of Code. Working on day 7 took me a while to figure out the solution, specially in part 2. But I did it.
I think the biggest issue that I faced was that I was still trying to think in terms of procedural programming and not functional programming. I&rsquo;m definitely not happy with the solution, again specially part 2, but it works.</dd>
