    <p>It’s been a while since my <a href="/posts/goodbye-theorem/">last post</a> here, not because I’m lazy (which I am), but because as you know I recently changed jobs. It’s been almost a month at my new place, and now I feel confident to say that I joined <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana Labs</a> as an SRE for the internal cloud platform!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today is my first day as an SRE at <a href="https://twitter.com/grafana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@grafana</a> !!! <a href="https://t.co/HMER6vcoNp">pic.twitter.com/HMER6vcoNp</a></p>&mdash; Lean (inkel) (@inkel) <a href="https://twitter.com/inkel/status/1366413070034173958?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2021</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>For most of my career I worked as a backend developer, only dabbling sporadically into an operations role, so I would be lying if I said that impostor syndrome didn&rsquo;t kick in during my first few days at this new role, but luckily my team is super friendly, helping, and understanding, and my confidence is getting bigger as days pass. I think I made the right decision deciding to jump into this new adventure.</p>
<p>Switching jobs is never easy, specially after almost a decade at my previous work, and thus some of my schedules were affected, like the weekly cadence of <a href="https://buttondown.email/inkel">newsletter</a> or writing into this blog. I hope to get back into rhythm soon.</p>
<p>This past month I&rsquo;ve spent it mostly going through the onboarding process, getting to know my team, some other teams' leaders, and familiarizing with the codebase and tools like <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/">Grafana</a>, <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/loki/">Loki</a>, and <a href="https://grafana.com/oss/tanka/">Tanka</a>. And I&rsquo;ve even found the time to add a <a href="https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet/pull/525">performance contribution</a> to a third-party library!</p>
<p>There are still lots of things to learn, but for now I&rsquo;ll  continue to learn more about this amazing company and the work I&rsquo;ll be doing, improving my skills, and learning a few more tricks. The future looks really bright!</p>

    <p>Today is my final day at <a href="https://theorem.co/">Theorem</a> after almost 10 years. It is a day full of mixed feelings for me, as I&rsquo;m excited for what&rsquo;s waiting for me next week (more on that, well, next week) and I&rsquo;m saddened for leaving this amazing team of friendly and talented human beings.</p>
<p>When I joined the Citrusbyte, how it was named at the time, we were less than 20 people working in a hectic but fun and creative environment.  And while it might seem hard to believe, that same spirit is still around all these years later, although luckily is not (that) hectic anymore.</p>
<p>Not only the company grew throughout but so did I. I went from being a single guy who had just bought an apartment doing nothing more than programming and reading all day to a father of two and owner of a house. And this company always had my back because all of us employees are treated like people.</p>
<p>But I digress…</p>
<p>Yesterday I&rsquo;ve got a farewell Meet call with lots of teammates, and I would be lying if I wouldn&rsquo;t say that afterwards my ego was the size of a continent, I&rsquo;m happy and proud of leaving a mark on Citrusbyte/Theorem&rsquo;s culture, and I will forever be grateful and honoured for this past decade. And who knows, maybe someday I&rsquo;ll return with new tricks to share.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for a solution to add comments to this blog, but none of them convinced me, as required adding some JavaScript or <code>IFRAME</code>, which doesn&rsquo;t feel right, so I decided to try a new approach and I&rsquo;ve enabled <a href="https://github.com/inkel/inkel.github.io/discussions">GitHub Discussions</a> in the repository where this blog&rsquo;s content is hosted. I still have to create an entry for each post, which is a tiresome process as there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an API for it yet, and also I haven&rsquo;t decided if that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to have or have you creating a new discussion if needed.</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s finally over. This awful year has ended. My work life <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/typical-workday-at-theorem/">hasn&rsquo;t changed much</a>, although I had to <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/work-blocks/">organize my work blocks</a> in a better way. My personal life, on the other hand, was quite affected, specially for my kids and partner; they were the most affected by having to start kindergarden classes via Zoom (my kids), and almost completely stop they work life (my partner).</p>
<p>I did manage to do some stuff that I find nice to share, and hopefully will continue doing in 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>I dedicated more time to this blog again.</li>
<li>I have a <a href="https://buttondown.email/inkel" title="inkelinks">newsletter</a> now; please go and subscribe!</li>
<li>For the first time in my life I joined the <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode-2020/">Advent of Code</a>, although for different reasons I&rsquo;ve stopped working on the challenges; I&rsquo;m planning on continue with them in my upcoming vacations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in <em>magical dates</em> and I know it&rsquo;s not that January 1st, 2021 will be automatically better: COVID-19 still exists, travel is restricted, the economy in this country (Argentina) isn&rsquo;t getting any better, etc, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to see what the new year will bring and work on making things better, not only for me, but for my family.</p>
