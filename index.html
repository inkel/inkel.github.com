    <p>So far these are the challenges that I liked the most, I think. Also, a feeling that I&rsquo;ve been having lately was that the code is a mess (to be expected because I&rsquo;m learning) and this particular <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/9d2a63040272bf79338680d51ad1c6765aa67703/src/adventofcode_2020/day6.clj">day&rsquo;s solutions</a> showed me exactly that: there are lots of refactorings to apply that will make the code more reusable and maintainable. I don&rsquo;t plan on doing that yet, but it&rsquo;s likely I&rsquo;ll do it in the upcoming days.</p>

<p>One thing that I always knew <strong>theoretically</strong> but now I can confirm because of working with it the last few days is that the level of expressiveness is astonishing. I was very comfortable when I was programming in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> because I felt that it was too easy to translate my thoughts into code, but I&rsquo;ve got to confess that while I&rsquo;m nowhere near that level of comfort, I&rsquo;m liking it more and more as each day passes.</p>

    <p>Last night I solved day 4 part 1 of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/">Advent of Code 2020</a> challenge, and this morning I finally solved part 2, thus <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/4d050447311b70d4dd99b8214a14c7c3039afe17/src/adventofcode_2020/day4.clj">solving day 4</a> completely. While arguably days <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode2020-day2/">2</a>, <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode2020-day3/">3</a>, and 4 have &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; challenges than <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode2020-day1/">day 1</a>, they were still challenging, specially given how unfamiliar I am with Clojure&rsquo;s syntax and API.</p>
<p>I feel more confident as each day passes, and I&rsquo;m getting more proficient with the environment as well. I hope that by the end of Advent of Code I feel confident enough to try Clojure in a small project at <a href="https://theorem.co/">work</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting more familiar with Clojure, and the tools I use for this project: <a href="https://leiningen.org">Leiningen</a>, Emacs + <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a>. About the latter, I know I could be more efficient if I knew the commands better, but so far it is really useful and I&rsquo;m not only learning tons but also in awe as to how well integrated this tool is.</p>

<p>I also like that I think my Clojure programming style is getting better as the time passes, which in the end was my sole main objective.</p>

    <p>I did it! I was finally to solve both <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/e80cb5b5be71002516c89e95dc86bd857e678eec/src/adventofcode_2020/day1.clj">Day 1 challenges in Clojure</a>! And it only took me four days!</p>
<p>As said in my <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode-2020/">previous post</a> one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m participating in this years <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent of Code</a> is because I want to learn <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, and while at times I felt frustrated because I couldn&rsquo;t find the solution, I&rsquo;m happy that I did. As with everything, in hindsight, the solution is obvious now. Not that while the problems were similar, both solutions are quite different, and I think they showcase my improvement with the language and functional way of thinking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to Day 2 challenges, and I hope to solve them in less than four days!</p>

    <p><a href="https://buttondown.email/inkel/archive/inkelinks-s01e02/">Issue #2 of my newsletter</a> was delivered today. I&rsquo;m really enjoying curating links and sharing them with friends! In case you missed it, here it is:</p>
<p>Yes! Welcome to a new issue of inkelinks. Last time it was the first one and of course I had a typo on the subject 😞 but all the links were working, so there’s that 💪🏽</p>
<p>In this issue you’ll find the regular links section plus a new <em>Podcast Episode of the Week</em> section where I’ll share a single link to an episode of the many podcasts that I listen to that I think has value for sharing. I hope you like it!</p>
<p>As always your feedback and suggestions are welcomed!</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://owenou.com/upterm/">Upterm - Secure Terminal Sharing</a><br>
I never did too much pair programming, but for sure this looks like an interesting take on making it easier to share a terminal with others.</li>
<li><a href="https://jpmens.net/2016/03/05/a-shell-command-to-create-json-jo/">A shell command to create JSON: jo</a><br>
My good friend Matías Aguirre (<a href="https://twitter.com/linuxaddict">@linuxaddict on Twitter</a>) shared this with me. I can’t believe I’ve never heard of it before, this is an awesome utility!</li>
<li><a href="https://metaredux.com/posts/2020/07/07/supercharge-your-bash-history.html">Supercharge Your Bash History</a><br>
Excellent article on how to configure Bash history to show meaningful information and not just every single thing you type in your terminal.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/vc/">How to make video calls almost as good as face-to-face</a><br>
In this day and era, video calls are becoming more important at every minute. This article might seem long, but the tl;dr section is concise to give you already lots of pointers. Sadly, for folks like myself in countries where technology is becoming too expensive this will be a “look at how good my setup could be” article.</li>
<li><a href="https://gauthier.uk/blog/who/">The UNIX <code>who</code> command</a><br>
Nice and short post on how using simple tools like <code>strace</code> and <code>man</code> one can mimic the behavior of a program.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="podcast-episode-of-the-week">Podcast episode of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://changelog.com/gotime/145">Füźžįñg with Katie Hockman, Roberto Clapis, &amp; Filippo Valsorda</a><br>
One of my favourite podcast shows is Go Time, and not so long ago they released an episode on fuzzing, a testing technique where you provide invalid data to your program and monitor for crashes. Whether you’re a Go developer or not this episode is highly recommended of only because you’ll learn new things!</p>

    <p>For years I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the idea behind <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a variety of reasons I&rsquo;ve neglected participating in <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/events">past editions</a>, but this year I&rsquo;ve finally decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>The biggest reason behind the decision to join this year was that for the longest time I had the desire to become proficient in any of the many LISP languages out there, particularly in <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, so I saw this as a chance to get more familiar with it, learn something more about it, and having fun while doing so.</p>
<p>There are already 2 puzzles going on, and I haven&rsquo;t even started, but when I do I also plan to publish everything into my <a href="https://github.com/inkel/">GitHub account</a>.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/">Essays on programming I think about a lot</a><br>
Over time I found many of the linked essays individually, so it’s nice to have them all in one place. Highly recommended!</li>

I’m looking for a new font, this looks like a nice place to start.</li>

    <p>One thing I like to do is collect links for reading later, and let&rsquo;s be honest, who hasn&rsquo;t? I also usually share some interesting links with folks at work, where I made myself the fame as the <em>links provider</em>. So that got me thinking: why not creating a newsletter where I can share these links with a broader audience? So thank you to <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a> I now have a newsletter for you: <a href="https://buttondown.email/inkel">inkelinks</a>.</p>
<p>Besides the newsletter I&rsquo;ll be posting the links on this blog too, for those who prefer it that way. But I suggest using the form below so you don&rsquo;t miss any weekly links!</p>
