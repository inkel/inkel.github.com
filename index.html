    <p>It&rsquo;s finally over. This awful year has ended. My work life <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/typical-workday-at-theorem/">hasn&rsquo;t changed much</a>, although I had to <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/work-blocks/">organize my work blocks</a> in a better way. My personal life, on the other hand, was quite affected, specially for my kids and partner; they were the most affected by having to start kindergarden classes via Zoom (my kids), and almost completely stop they work life (my partner).</p>
<p>I did manage to do some stuff that I find nice to share, and hopefully will continue doing in 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>I dedicated more time to this blog again.</li>
<li>I have a <a href="https://buttondown.email/inkel" title="inkelinks">newsletter</a> now; please go and subscribe!</li>
<li>For the first time in my life I joined the <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode-2020/">Advent of Code</a>, although for different reasons I&rsquo;ve stopped working on the challenges; I&rsquo;m planning on continue with them in my upcoming vacations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in <em>magical dates</em> and I know it&rsquo;s not that January 1st, 2021 will be automatically better: COVID-19 still exists, travel is restricted, the economy in this country (Argentina) isn&rsquo;t getting any better, etc, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to see what the new year will bring and work on making things better, not only for me, but for my family.</p>

    <p>I had a very busy couple of days at work, so I couldn&rsquo;t get too much done in Advent of Code. Working on day 7 took me a while to figure out the <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/5300bc3ad6936f39a2d027050b5b32ecf5dba577/src/adventofcode_2020/day7.clj">solution</a>, specially in part 2. But I did it.</p>
<p>I think the biggest issue that I faced was that I was still trying to think in terms of procedural programming and not functional programming. I&rsquo;m definitely not happy with the solution, again <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/5300bc3ad6936f39a2d027050b5b32ecf5dba577/src/adventofcode_2020/day7.clj#L55-L60">specially part 2</a>, but it works. I&rsquo;m definitely looking forward to start refactoring the code and looking for better solutions.</p>

    <p>¡Hola, amigos! Friday means a new issue of inkelinks. Today I bring you some links on design and history of the program and utilities we, or at least I, use mostly.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://warpspire.com/posts/url-design">URL Design</a><br>
Old but gold. Kyle Neath was one of the original designers at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, and in this essay he talks about how to build good URLs and why that’s important. I keep coming back to this article from time to time, because it’s timeless.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/nextux/design-better-forms-96fadca0f49c#.ziclgg10o">Design Better Forms</a><br>
<em>Common mistakes designers make and how to fix them</em>. Oh boy, many times I was guilty of doing most of these! Definitely not exclusively for designers; if you ever need to implement a form, you <strong>are</strong> to check this post, print it, frame it, and hang it in an always visible place near your computer. Your users will thank you.</li>
<li><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/11/12/cat.html">The Source History of Cat</a><br>
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/cat"><code>cat</code></a>is undeniably one of most used programs in any *nix based operating system, and this is a nice article trying to find out more about it by inspecting its source code. Recommended to accompany a cup of coffee.</li>
<li><a href="https://thenewstack.io/brian-kernighan-remembers-the-origins-of-grep/">Brian Kernighan Remembers the Origins of ‘grep’</a><br>
My life wouldn’t be the same if it weren’t for <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep"><code>grep</code></a>. I simply love it. And like the article above this is also about the history of a command, but in a different way and told by someone directly linked to its inception.</li>
<li><a href="https://work.lisk.in/2020/11/20/even-faster-bash-startup.html">Even faster bash startup</a><br>
As a Bash user I’ve found this article very enlightening. I’ve got to go through all my computers to check my startup times, I’m sure I will greatly benefit from it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="podcast-episode-of-the-week">Podcast episode of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://corecursive.com/058-brian-kernighan-unix-bell-labs/">The Birth of UNIX with Brian Kernighan</a><br>
Yes, Brian Kernighan again. What can I say? I love the man, he is one of my programming heroes. And this interview is just fantastic. At 51 minutes it can be a bit long, but let me assure that you’ll do yourself a favour if you dedicate some time to just sit back and listen to it… but if you can’t do that, DON’T PANIC! There’s a transcript of it.</p>

    <p>So far these are the challenges that I liked the most, I think. Also, a feeling that I&rsquo;ve been having lately was that the code is a mess (to be expected because I&rsquo;m learning) and this particular <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/9d2a63040272bf79338680d51ad1c6765aa67703/src/adventofcode_2020/day6.clj">day&rsquo;s solutions</a> showed me exactly that: there are lots of refactorings to apply that will make the code more reusable and maintainable. I don&rsquo;t plan on doing that yet, but it&rsquo;s likely I&rsquo;ll do it in the upcoming days.</p>

<p>One thing that I always knew <strong>theoretically</strong> but now I can confirm because of working with it the last few days is that the level of expressiveness is astonishing. I was very comfortable when I was programming in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> because I felt that it was too easy to translate my thoughts into code, but I&rsquo;ve got to confess that while I&rsquo;m nowhere near that level of comfort, I&rsquo;m liking it more and more as each day passes.</p>

    <p>Last night I solved day 4 part 1 of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/">Advent of Code 2020</a> challenge, and this morning I finally solved part 2, thus <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/4d050447311b70d4dd99b8214a14c7c3039afe17/src/adventofcode_2020/day4.clj">solving day 4</a> completely. While arguably days <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode2020-day2/">2</a>, <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode2020-day3/">3</a>, and 4 have &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; challenges than <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode2020-day1/">day 1</a>, they were still challenging, specially given how unfamiliar I am with Clojure&rsquo;s syntax and API.</p>
<p>I feel more confident as each day passes, and I&rsquo;m getting more proficient with the environment as well. I hope that by the end of Advent of Code I feel confident enough to try Clojure in a small project at <a href="https://theorem.co/">work</a>.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m on a roll! Day 1 was <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode2020-day1/">painful</a>; in day 2 I did some <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode2020-day2/">improvements</a>, and now <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/5bbf796dba907e708ed3a68874bfaa12745d5bb6/src/adventofcode_2020/day3.clj">day 3 was also solved</a> in less than 2 hours!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting more familiar with Clojure, and the tools I use for this project: <a href="https://leiningen.org">Leiningen</a>, Emacs + <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a>. About the latter, I know I could be more efficient if I knew the commands better, but so far it is really useful and I&rsquo;m not only learning tons but also in awe as to how well integrated this tool is.</p>

    <p>Funny how <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode2020-day1/">day 1 took me 4 days to solve</a> but I was able to <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/bc2b6ef16bcf6b7e7425702f1732c67a1da9387e/src/adventofcode_2020/day2.clj">solve day 2</a> in just an hour. I guess the challenges are not strictly in a increasing order of complexity.</p>
<p>I also like that I think my Clojure programming style is getting better as the time passes, which in the end was my sole main objective.</p>
<p>Let’s see what day 3 lies ahead…</p>

    <p>I did it! I was finally to solve both <a href="https://github.com/inkel/adventofcode-2020/blob/e80cb5b5be71002516c89e95dc86bd857e678eec/src/adventofcode_2020/day1.clj">Day 1 challenges in Clojure</a>! And it only took me four days!</p>
<p>As said in my <a href="https://inkel.github.io/posts/adventofcode-2020/">previous post</a> one of the reasons why I&rsquo;m participating in this years <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent of Code</a> is because I want to learn <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, and while at times I felt frustrated because I couldn&rsquo;t find the solution, I&rsquo;m happy that I did. As with everything, in hindsight, the solution is obvious now. Not that while the problems were similar, both solutions are quite different, and I think they showcase my improvement with the language and functional way of thinking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to Day 2 challenges, and I hope to solve them in less than four days!</p>
